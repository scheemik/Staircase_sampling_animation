# Staircase sampling animation

by Mikhail Schee

This repo creates an animation which is intended to demonstrate why taking multiple profiles of the same thermohaline staircase in the ocean will result in clusters because you will get many points that have approximately the same temperature and salinity. 

In the animation, there are two plots with example hydrographic profiles from Ice-Tethered Profilers, both taken in the Arctic Ocean. On the left, there is an example with a typical staircase structure. On the right, there is a profile which has no staircase structure. As the sampling points scan across the profiles, the plot on the right shows how the majority of the time, the sampling points are within the layers, finding similar values of temperature and salinity. This is opposed to how, on the right-hand profile, the sampling points move across the depth range, sampling the full range of salinity and temperature pretty much evenly. This difference can be seen in the figure `ITP8-1301_v_ITP1-1259_T-S.png` where I've plotted all the sampling points for each example profile in temperature vs. salinity (T-S) space. However, in that plot, the profiles are on opposite sides.
